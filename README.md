This is Judy Zhang's submission for the CapitalOne Challenge.

The main HTML file can be found under /startbootstrap-scrolling-nav-gh-pages/index.html.

The backend files that generated the HTML graphs are main.py and widget.py. They require the pandas, gmplot, and bokeh modules. A Google API Key is also required for the maps features.

Enjoy the site!
