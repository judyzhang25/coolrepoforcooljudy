            <h2>About this page</h2>
            <p class="lead">An increase in a city's population surgest the number of emergency call volume and response rate. Trends in existing data may assist our services in being better prepared and more readily available to handle emergency situations.</p><br> 
            <p>The SF Data Analytics team has prepared a series of graphs and metrics to provide statistics and additional information regarding the quality of current services. This page seeks to answer questions such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which areas take the longest time to dispatch to on average? How can this be reduced?</li>
              <li>Given an address and time, what is the most likely dispatch to be required?</li>
              <li>How might time of day affect dispatch response time?</li>
              <li>Is there a difference between average dispatch response time and individual unit response time?</li>
              <li>Which neighborhoods place the most emergency calls?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following facts and figures may provide some answers for these insightful inquiries.</p>

            <h2>Facts</h2>
            <p class="lead">Some areas of San Francisco experience a higher level of incidents than others. From past data, we can analyze certain trends, such as which services are most required in which areas or what time of day are calls most frequently placed, to predict needs and determine where our services are best allocated.</p><br> 

            <p>One metric we have taken note of is the neighborhood that takes the longest time to dispatch to, on average. The zipcode area of <em>94129</em> takes the longest to dispatch to, with an average time of <em>15.138 minutes</em>. The most common unit to dispatch to this zipcode are <em>fire engines</em>. A strategy to reduce travel time is having our 911 dispatchers notify units of estimated time arrival and potential delays when dispatching them to this neighborhood. The team may be advised to pay greater attention to traffic conditions or take advantage of local shortcuts in order to avoid unforeseen accidents. Specifically when fire engines are dispatched, the department may advised to gain more familiarity with the area and heighten their sense of urgency when heading to this area.</p><br>

            <p>Predicting where our units need to be at what time is also crucial to handling emergency situations. We, here at the Data Analytics team, have generated a simulator that evaluates past incidents and predicts which unit is most needed given the area and the time of day. Enter a zipcode and time below to see which unit will be deployed:</p>

            <h2>Figures</h2>
            <p class="lead">Visualization of data assists in understanding correlation. The figures that follow study the relationship between when the emergency call was placed and how quickly emergency responders can arrive on scene.</p><br>
            <p>Categorizing the calls into certain time intervals in a day yields patterns in the data. Below is a line graph mapping the relationship between call time and average dispatch time.</p><br>
            <iframe width="750" height="450" src="../response_tabs.html" ></iframe><br><br>
            <p>Even more specifically, the relationship between average ambulance transport time and call time is displayed below.</p><br>
            <iframe width="750" height="450" src="../ambulance_tabs.html" ></iframe><br><br>
            <p>As we generalize our time intervals from every quarter to every half hour to every hour, trends start appearing in the data. Since average response time depends on various units rather than one singular one, we can identify several peak dispatch response times. However, the average stays consistent around <em>8-10 minutes</em>. On the other hand, singling out the medical unit shows clearly that ambulances require more time in transit during the day than the evening. It appears medical transport takes the longest at 7:00 am, 9:00 am, and 6:00 pm, according to the hourly data. Furthermore, each trip takes longer on average, ranging from <em>35-45 minutes</em>. Thus there is a correlation between call time and dispatch time, as well as discrepancies in dispatch time per unit type.</p>

            <p>Understanding which areas place the most frequent calls also allows for SFPD to predict where resources are most necessary. Below is a heatmap of San Francisco indicating the parts of the city in which the most emergency calls are made. As anticipated, the most populated areas place the most distress calls.</p><br>
